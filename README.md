# SimpleMatrix
> Lightweight JavaScript library for basic matrix computations.

**SimpleMatrix** is a very lightweight JavaScript library for matrix computations. Matrices are specified using the array literal notation already available in the Javascript language.

The library adds the namespace: `SimpleMatrix` to the global `window` object when used in the browser and all its methods can be accessed via that namespace. Here are the available methods:

- ok
- dimension
- unit
- equal
- sum
- product
- transpose
- minors
- cofactors
- adjoint
- determinant
- inverse
